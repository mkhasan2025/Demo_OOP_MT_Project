This code sample demonstrates an example of object oriented programming architecture (following factory pattern and singletone design pattern) and some interesting concepts of multi-threading programming. The example has been set for a image/video processing solution but these techniques can be used for any kind of solution.

I will keep adding more comments and refine the code structure.
