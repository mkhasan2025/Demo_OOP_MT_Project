This code sample demonstrates an example of object oriented programming architecture (following factory pattern and singletone design pattern) and some interesting concepts of multi-threading programming. This project was not done for any particular application area. Even though, this example has been set for a image/video processing solution, these techniques can be used for any kind of software solution.

For your understanding, I have added a lot of comments in all the files. I will keep adding more comments and refine the code structure.
