This code sample demonstrates an example of object oriented programming architecture (following factory pattern and singletone design pattern) and some interesting concepts of multi-threading programming. This project was not done for any particular application area. Even though, this example has been set for a image/video processing solution, these techniques can be used for any kind of software solution.

Objective of this project:
  A. Demonstrate an object oriented architecture that ensures:
    1. Hiding implementation detail from the outside world (eg. outside of a library);
    2. Simple and easy interface to interact with different features/versions of a solution;
    3. High maintainability and extendibility of the code;
    4. Portability of the code and simple module based integration; 
    5. Easy coordination and data sharing among the classes.

  B. Demonstrate a multi-threading software framework that ensures:
    1. Robust thread synchronization and task based parallelization
    2. Simple API for multi-thread synchronization module

For your understanding, I have added a lot of comments in all the files. I will keep adding more comments and refining the code structure.
