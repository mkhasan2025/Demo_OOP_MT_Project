This code sample demonstrates an example of object oriented programming architecture (following factory pattern and singletone design pattern) and some interesting concepts of multi-threading programming. This project was not done for any particular application area. Even though, this example has been set for a image/video processing solution, these techniques can be used for any kind of software solution.

Objective of this project:
  1. Demonstrate an object oriented architecture that ensures:
    a. Hiding implementation detail from the outside world (eg. outside of a library);
    b. Simple and easy interface to interact with different features/versions of a solution;
    c. High maintainability and extendibility of the code;
    d. Portability of the code and simple module based integration; 
    f. Easy coordination and data sharing among the classes.

  2. Demonstrate a multi-threading software framework that ensures:
    a. Robust thread synchronization and task based parallelization
    b. Simple API for multi-thread synchronization module 

For your understanding, I have added a lot of comments in all the files. I will keep adding more comments and refining the code structure.
